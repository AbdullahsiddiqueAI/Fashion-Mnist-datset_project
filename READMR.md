# MNIST Fashion Classification using TensorFlow
This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for classifying fashion items using the MNIST Fashion dataset with TensorFlow.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 categories of clothing items.

# Introduction
The goal is to build a neural network model that can accurately classify images of fashion items into their respective categories using deep learning techniques.

# Environment Setup
Ensure you have TensorFlow installed in your Python environment to run the code. You can install TensorFlow using pip:

# Copy code
pip install tensorflow
Implementation


# Loading and Preprocessing Data
The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist module.
Training and test images are normalized to scale pixel values to the range [0, 1].

# Model Architecture
A sequential neural network model is built using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
The model consists of:
Flatten layer: Flattens the 2D array of pixel values into a 1D array.
Dense layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax activation for the output layer.
Compilation and Training
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric.
Training is performed using model.fit() on the training data for 10 epochs.
Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the test data with model.evaluate().
The evaluation provides metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Early Stopping Callback
An early stopping callback (myCallback) is implemented to monitor training accuracy.
Training stops early if the accuracy reaches 60% to prevent overfitting.


# Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation of a basic neural network for image classification using TensorFlow on the Fashion MNIST dataset. By training this model, it demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to recognize and classify fashion items from images.
